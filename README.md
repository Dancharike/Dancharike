- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dancharike
- 👀 I’m interested in making video games
- 🌱 I’m currently learning sofrware engeneering
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on LinkedIn, so you can reach me by: https://www.linkedin.com/in/denis-kladijev-0440b236b

- For now i'm busy with my personal project, the code name - Beresta, which should be some kind of a open source brand related to: scripting language, IDE, and game engine.
- I already created some kind of a language, for now it is not quite full-fledged, but i'm trying to update it as i grow as a developer!
- You can find it in one of my public repos that is cold - BerestaLanguage

- Some day i will make it great and well polished
- But for now you can also find my profile by some of my games that i made and uploaded a source code, so it would be nice to have a small talk with you of what you experienced in my games!

- But for now
- Работайте Братья!🏋️‍♂️
